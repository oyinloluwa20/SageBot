SageBot is a web application designed to serve as a code debugger with an benefit of retrieval augmented generation. It allows users to create projects, manage files, edit code, and interact with an AI-powered language model for debugging code, the AI model is also supercharged with a custom built langchain agent that has internet connectivity and can accept data from an api endpoint .

Getting Started

Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- [OpenAI API Key] (for AI-powered language model functionality)
